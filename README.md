# Niptuk

This is a super simple Docker container monitor TUI written in Rust.

## Notes

This is kind of an experiment in using an AI to write an application. It doesn't appear to be an optimized solution, as compared to something like `ctop` which has similar functionality. This app seems to use more CPU than `ctop` and doesn't refresh container status as often. But otherwise, the AI produced a pretty adequate TUI, and was able to adjust to add functionality as subsequently requested.
